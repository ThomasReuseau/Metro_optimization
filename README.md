<h1> Paris Metro Project </h1>

The goal is to pass in one day by all the metro stations in Paris. 
We have to go at least once (though not necessarily one) by each of the Paris metro stations intramural, during a day.

2 datasets are provided
=> The edges dataset & vertices dataset

This problem were solved thanks to Dijkstra Algorithm which is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.
